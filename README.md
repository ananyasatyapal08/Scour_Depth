# Scour_Depth 

**Scour_Depth** is a research-/data-science project focused on predicting scour depth over non-uniform sediment beds (and related phenomena) using machine learning (for example XGBoost and PSO) as part of the 10-day research assignment for jet cover-bed scour.  

##  Repository Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the key files and folders (please update according to your actual structure):


##  Project Objective & Context

- This work was undertaken for a 10-day research task assigned by a professor on scour depth prediction on non-uniform sediment beds.  
- The goal: Collect at least 100 data points, preprocess them, and build a predictive model for scour depth using machine learning (XGBoost) and optimization (PSO).  
- The domain context: Scour (erosion) around structures (jets, covers, sediment beds) is an important topic in hydraulics and coastal/river engineering.  
- For you (Ananya Satyapal), this project aligns with your research internship preparation and enhances your data science/ML portfolio.

##  Why This Project?

- Scour depth prediction is relevant for infrastructure design (bridges, marine structures) and environmental management.  
- Applying machine-learning/optimization methods to physics/engineering problems shows cross-disciplinary strength (engineering + data science).  
- This project strengthens your résumé for internships (e.g., at D. E. Shaw, etc.) and supports your path to mastering ML & DL.
